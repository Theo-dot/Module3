    <h4>by 5 Seconds of Summer</h4>
    <p>
      Remember the words you told me<br />
      Love me till the day I die<br />
      Surrender my everything<br />
      'Cause you made me believe you’re mine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yeah, you used to call me baby<br />
      Now you’re calling me by name <br />
      Takes one to know one, yeah <br />
      You beat me at my own damn game.
    </p>

    <p>
      You push and you push and I’m pulling away<br />
      Pulling away from you<br />
      I give and I give and I give and you take<br />
      Give and you take.
    </p>

    <p>
      Youngblood<br />
      Say you want me, say you want me<br />
      Out of your life <br />
      And I’m just a dead man walking tonight <br />
      But you need it, yeah you need it <br />
      All of the time <br />
      Yeah ooh, ooh, ooh x2
    </p>

    <p>
      Lately our conversations <br />
      End like it’s the last goodbye <br />
      Till one of us gets too drunk <br />
      And calls about a hundred times.
    </p>

    <p>
      So who you've been calling baby? <br />
      Nobody could take my place <br />
      When you looking at those strangers <br />
      Hope to God you see my face.
